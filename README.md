# Terraform-Azure-Project
This is a beginner project to practice deployment to Azure using Terraform in VS Code. 

## First Stage
In this stage I used ChatGPT to help plan a beginner project. This project will contain two VNets, multiple VMs, and possibly a couple of other resources including an app gateway and load balancer. The initial git push included me beginning the setup in my Terraform file. This included the main.tf and .gitignore.
